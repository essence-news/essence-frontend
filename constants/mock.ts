        "Oliver’s Market, a beloved grocery chain in Sonoma County, has officially become 100% employee-owned, marking a significant transition in its ownership structure. Founded by Steve Maass in 1988, the chain previously sold 43% of its shares to employees in 2017, finalizing the sale of the remaining 57% on October 31, 2024. The employees now own their shares through an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), which functions similarly to a retirement plan, allowing for annual allocations of shares at no cost. Maass, committed to maintaining the store's independence, emphasized the importance of community partnerships and preserving local jobs over selling to larger chains. With over 900 employees, many of whom have been with the company for over two decades, Oliver's Market prides itself on its unique employee-driven culture. General Manager Scott Gross noted that this decision reflects a dedication to job preservation. The move solidifies Oliver's Market's role as a vital part of the community, ensuring that it remains a local staple rather than succumbing to corporate ownership.",
